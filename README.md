# IGW with GYRE
Here we're looking at IGWs in main sequence intermediate and massive stars. The idea is to look at g-modes with GYRE using MESA background structures.
We calculate non-adiabatic mdes since we're interested in the surface manifestation of the waves and radiative damping is important. The normalization will come using Daniel Lecoanet theory + numerical simulations (DEDALUS). We then plan to compare to COROT/K2/TESS observations.
